## Library Management System

This repository contains both the backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (React) for the Library Management System.

### Backend (Spring Boot)
1. Navigate to the 'backend' folder:
   cd backend
   
2. Run the backend:
	mvn spring-boot:run

###Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend folder
	cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
	npm install

3. Start the frontend:
	npm start

### **Advantages of Keeping Frontend and Backend in One Repository**
1. **Simplified Version Control**: Easier to track changes across both frontend and backend.
2. **Synchronized Changes**: Frontend and backend changes are part of the same commit, ensuring compatibility.
3. **Easier Collaboration**: Developers can clone one repository to access the entire project.

---

### **Disadvantages**
1. **Repository Size**: The repository might grow large if both frontend and backend generate build artifacts.
2. **Deployment Complexity**: If you deploy the frontend and backend separately, consider whether a monorepo fits your workflow.

---

### **Final Notes**
After organizing and committing the project:
1. Verify on GitHub that the changes are reflected.
2. Test both the frontend and backend locally to ensure nothing is broken.
